What is Minium 
--------------

[Minium](http://minium.vilt.io/) is a framework developed at [VILT](http://vilt-group.com) that helps you test your web application the same way a human would.

Minium has spawned from the work of Rui Figueira @VILT and that initial code base is now known as Minium Core. It combines jQuery and Selenium for browser testing and tasks automation.

Minium Developer Is a console aimed at developers, allowing the creation of automatic tasks in the browser to be used in end-to-end testing of your web applications. 
Minium is both powerful and simple: tests can be written in cucumber even by non-technical people, but you can integrate with your base code in any language by exposing a RESTful service. 
All these features make Minium a great way for you to integrate Behaviour Driven Development practices through out all phases of your project

The last component of Minium Tools is known as Minium Manager. It's aimed at business solutions, it's a more powerful console that provides useful reports of the ongoing projects and has a strong component in continuous integration.
